They're not even close to the first to play this game. Others have done it before, and will again. It's all about the proportional return on investment based on the various available payouts.

It looks like we'll have to operate
And there is good reason to expect tax increases to come in the future. I'm fairly certain the commitee's recommendation will include something along the lines of letting the Bush tax cuts expire (partially), the automatic alternative being cuts in defense spending.

Well then they should have simply opened one auction house that used in game currency. Ive used D2JSP more than I care to admit and so have many others I know and have never spent a cent.

On Gelbooru, you can search for things based on tags, so you should be able to cut out most tentacle things. Unless you want video. That makes searching a bit harder.

The same way you might view a German. They are different people. They speak a different language. They observe different customs. They're different. Is there a specific way I am suppose to view them?

If you skip the maintenance, it can void (part of?) the manufacturer's warranty.  The value of a warranty is probably way more than the cost of an oil change.

Much like Bethesda and Bioware fanboys the Blizzard loving hordes will gobble this gunk and ask for seconds. Never doubt in the weak will of the gaming community.
The blazer pictured looks to be made of fleece (sweatshirt material), whereas the Asos blazer is made of jersey (t-shirt material, or similar). So the Rugby one is going to be warmer and thicker than the Asos one. Just so OP knows...

Yeah but you have to admit how much bigger it got with the launch of SC2.
Thanks! I was looking for an unofficial schedule, like a trip by the team to the local school etc. Sorry I was not clear. I do intend to attend the game against Kent but not sure if I can meet any players there.
I think it's justified already.  Oh wait... never mind... it's clearly left-alligned. My bad. At least it isn't centered, or *gasp* right-alligned! How silly that would have been!

They also don't have enough players who are training 6h+/day playing against them so even if the EG house were to start training seriously they would have a hard time catching up to the Koreans due to lack of pro competition on the NA servers.

Meh, I've been a huge blizzard fan but passed on SC2, and I'll probably pass on D3. Companies change, and it's apparent that Activision has complete control over Blizzard.
